				<p>Built in 1903, the Kappa Sigma house boasts a hotel-esque Grand Hall, dozens of bodacious bedrooms, and a roof space that surveys the waters of Cayuga. Our house is known for its sophisticated affinity for boisterous energy and couth stateliness. Upon entering, you may be drawn to our pristine Chapter Room or the sweeping landscape views from which our windows present, but the most special characteristic of our house is truly the venerable and well-cultured men who gather there. Our house has given us so many of our fondest memories throughout our lives and we are so proud to call it our home.</p>
