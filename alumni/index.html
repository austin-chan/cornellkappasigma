    <h3>Cornell Kappa Sigma Alumni</h3>
    <h5>Get Involved</h5>
    <p>
      We are always thrilled when our alumni choose to give back to their Brotherhood by getting involved. We have a lot of great things planned for our future and greatly appreciate the support of our alumni through their time and dedication to the Chapter. If you are interested in getting involved in any way, please reach out to our Alumni Relations Chair, <a href="mailto:cjm366@cornell.edu">Connor McEnery</a>.
    </p>
    <h5>Donate</h5>
    <p>
      Donations of any amount directly help your Brothers of The Alpha Kappa Chapter of The Kappa Sigma Fraternity at Cornell. As your Brothers, we are beyond thankful for your contributions that help us achieve our goals, many of which are the same that you set out to achieve when you were a student at Cornell. Listed below are two ways you can financially contribute to our chapter.

    <p> 
      Donations made through this website with the "Kappa Sigma Group Housing Fund" selected will go directly to fund renovations and updates to our beautiful home at 600 University Ave. We are currently planning multiple housing improvements and renovations that will allow us, and future Kappa Sigmas to call this their home. For updates on these projects, and how you can help, please reach out to our Alumni Relations Chair, <a href="mailto:cjm366@cornell.edu">Connor McEnery</a> to be added to our newsletter.

    <p>
      Donations made to the Kappa Sigma Chapter Scholarship fund with the "Alpha-Kappa Chapter Scholarship Fund" selected will go directly to a scholarship fund that benefits Brothers of our chapter. Our Brothers apply to receive these scholarships and they help them achieve their goals by alleviating some financial burden that their education places on them and their families.
