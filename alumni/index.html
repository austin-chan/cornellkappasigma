    <h3>Cornell Kappa Sigma Alumni</h3>
    <h5>Get Involved</h5>
    <p>
      We are always thrilled when our alumni choose to give back to their Brotherhood by getting involved. We have a lot
      of great things planned for our
      future and greatly appreciate the support of our alumni through their time and dedication to the Chapter. If you
      are interested in getting involved
      in any way, please reach out to our Alumni Relations Chairs, <a href="mailto:nhk42@cornell.edu">Noah Kaplan</a> or
      <a href="mailto:jo447@cornell.edu">Josh Ochalek</a>.
    </p>
    <h5>Donate</h5>
    <p>
      Donations of any amount directly help your Brothers of The Alpha Kappa Chapter of The Kappa Sigma Fraternity at
      Cornell. As your Brothers, we are
      beyond thankful for your contributions that help us achieve our goals, many of which are the same that you set out
      to achieve when you were a
      student at Cornell. Listed below are two ways you can financially contribute to our chapter.

    <p>
      Donations made through this website with the "Kappa Sigma Group Housing Fund" selected will go directly to fund
      renovations and updates to our
      beautiful home at 600 University Ave. We are currently planning multiple housing improvements and renovations that
      will allow us, and future
      Kappa Sigmas to call this their home. For updates on these projects, and how you can help, please reach out to our
      Alumni Relations Chairs,
      <a href="mailto:nhk42@cornell.edu">Noah Kaplan</a> or <a href="mailto:jo447@cornell.edu">Josh Ochalek</a>, to be

      Kappa Sigma Chapter Scholarship Fund
    </a>
    <p>
      Donations made to the Kappa Sigma Chapter Scholarship fund with the "Alpha-Kappa Chapter Scholarship Fund"
      selected will go directly to a
      scholarship fund that benefits Brothers of our chapter. Our Brothers apply to receive these scholarships and they
      help them achieve their
      goals by alleviating some financial burden that their education places on them and their families.
