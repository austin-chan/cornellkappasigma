      <h3>Cornell Kappa Sigma Philanthropy</h3>
      <p>
        Our Chapter strives to be one of the most active organizations at Cornell University in terms of our philanthropic endeavors. Each semester, we organize many different events that fundraise or provide service to worth-while organizations, both locally and nationally. We also collaborate with other organzations at Cornell in order to ensure our efforts are as beneficial and widespread as possible. Over the past year, we have raised thousands of dollars for various charities. To learn about a few of our recent events, read below.

      <h5>Bottle and Can Drive</h5>
        <p>
          Each semester, our Chapter organizes a Bottle and Can Drive, takingn advantage of the New York State Bottle Bill which allows us to receive 5 cents per item we recycle. Last semester, we recycled well over five thousand items, much of which would likely have ended up in landfills, and with all proceeds going to local food banks. We did so with the help of many different participants who collected the items, and with the help of our Brothers who transported all the items to local recycling centers. We are planning to continue this event in the future and are hoping to collaborate with other organizations on campus to expand our impact.

      <h5>March Madness Bracket Contest</h5>
        <p>
          Each year, during March, our Chapter organizes an NCAA March Madness bracket contest. This year, proceeds were donated to the Good Sports charity.

      <h5>No-Shave-November</h5>
        <p>
          Each year, our Chapter participates in No-Shave-November. Many of our brothers participate, raising hundreds of dollars for charity, while growing some of the most manly, yet, elegant beards you have ever seen. Check out our Instagram account to see them for yourself!
