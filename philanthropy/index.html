      <h5>Cornell Kappa Sigma Philanthropy</h5>
      <p>Our Chapter strives to be one of the most active organizations at Cornell University in terms of our philanthropic endeavors. Each semester, we organize many different events that fundraise or provide service to worth-while organizations, both locally and nationally. We also collaborate with other organzations at Cornell in order to ensure our efforts are as beneficial and widespread as possible. To learn about a few of our recent events, read below.</p>

          Bottle and Can Drive
            <p style="margin-left: 0%;">
            During Spring 2021, our Chapter organized a Bottle and Can Drive that utilized the New York State Bottle Bill which allows residents to receive 5 cents per item that they recycle. During this semester we were able to recycle well over 5 thousand items, much of which would likely have ended up in landfills, and with all proceeds going to local food banks. We did so with the help of many different participants who collected the items, and with the help of our Brothers who transported all the items to local recycling centers. We are planning to continue this event in the future and are hoping to collaborate with other organizations on campus to expand our impact. </p>
